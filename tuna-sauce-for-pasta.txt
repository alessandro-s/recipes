Ingredients:

1 can of tuna in oil
half a large onion or all of a small onion
1 can of peeled whole tomatoes (or better yet, a bottle of not-too-thick tomato purée that would look something like like this)
olive oil
hot pepper (optional)
salt


Preparation:

1. Pour some olive oil into a steel-bottomed pan or pot. Add half a large onion, sliced into pieces as large or small as you like (I like my onions fairly chunky).
2. Sauté onions over medium-low heat until they soften a bit. Throw in about a teaspoon of salt.
3. Add the tuna and hot pepper, and sauté for another few minutes.
4. Before anything burns, add the tomatoes. Turn the heat up to medium-high until it starts simmering, then continue to simmer over medium-low heat for about 45-60 minutes, until most of the water evaporates away and you're left with tomato flesh and oil. While the sauce is simmering, you'll have to stir the mixture every few minutes to stop it from burning. You may have to lower the heat a little bit as you proceed—I tend to start with the heat at 5 or 6, and finish with the heat at 3 or 4.
